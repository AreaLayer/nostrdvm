# Nostr Data Vending Machine Python Implementation

This example DVM implementation in Python currently supports simple translations using Google translate, as well as extraction of text from links with pdf files.

At a later stage, additional example tasks will be added, as well as the integration into a larger Machine Learning backend 


Place .env file (based on .env_example) in main folder, install requirements.txt (python 3.10) run main.py. Optionally supports LNbits to create invoices instead of lnaddresses.

Use vendata.io to create a nip89 announcement of your dvm and save the dtag in your .env config.

A tutorial on how to add additional tasks, as well as the larger server backend will be added soon.
